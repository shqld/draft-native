# DraftNative
## Draft.js for ReactNative
An editor for ReactNative fully compatible Draft.js API and models.

**NOTE**: This project is now in development.

## Motivation
There aren't any rich text editor components without Webview in ReactNative ecosystem, afaik.

## Why this?
### Compatibility
DraftNative uses internally some Draft.js models e.g. `EditorState`, so you can manage states by injecting as props, as you do with Draft.js.

### No native dependencies
This library depends on just ReactNative's `TextInput`. There is no difference between Android and iOS.

## Features

## Contribution
